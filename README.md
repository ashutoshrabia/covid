To address the challenge health professionals face in staying current with the vast and rapidly growing literature on COVID-19, clustering techniques can be combined with dimensionality reduction to visualize this collection of research effectively. In this approach, a scatter plot represents the literature, where publications on closely related topics are grouped under the same label and plotted nearby. To understand these clusters further, topic modeling is applied to identify keywords that capture the core themes of each cluster.

Dataset : https://uofi.box.com/s/k8pw7d5kozzpoum2jwfaqdaey1oij93x

Data description : 1. CORD-NER-full.json: the full dataset including the meta-data, full-text corpus and CORD-19-NER results from the 29,500 documents in [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) corpus (2020-03-13). The size of the dataset is about 1.2GB. It includes the following items:

  - id: the line number (0-29499) in "all_sources_metadata_2020-03-13.csv" in the CORD-19 corpus (2020-03-13).
  - source: CZI (1236 records), PMC (27337), bioRxiv (566) and medRxiv (361).
  - doi: populated for all BioRxiv/MedRxiv paper records and most of the other records (26357 non null).
  - pmcid: populated for all PMC paper records (27337 non null).
  - pubmed_id: populated for some of the records.
  - Other meta-data: publish_time, authors and journal, title, abstract.
  - body: full-text corpus
  - entities: CORD-19-NER annotation results

Each line represents one document in the dataset. The file schema is shown as below.

```
{'id':0, 'source':'xxx', 'doi':'xxx', 'pmcid':'xxx', 'pubmed_id':'xxx', 'publish_time':'xxx', 'authors':'xxx', 'journal':'xxx', 'title':'xxx', 'abstract':'xxx', 'body':'xxx', 'entities':[{'text':'xxx', 'start':0, 'end':3, 'type':'xxx'}, ...]}, ...]}
...
```

2. CORD-NER-types.xlsx: entity type hierarchy used by CORD-19-NER.

3. CORD-NER-corpus.json: tokenized corpus generated by AutoPhrase and Spacy. Each line represents one document in the corpus. The file schema is shown as below.

```
{'doc_id':0, 'sents':[{'sent_id':0, 'sent_tokens':['xxx', ...]}, ...], 'source':'xxx', 'doi':'xxx', 'pmcid':'xxx', 'pubmed_id':'xxx', 'publish_time':'xxx', 'authors':'xxx', 'journal':'xxx'}
...
```

4. CORD-NER-ner.json: NER results generated on the tokenized corpus. Each line represents one document in the corpus. The file schema is shown as below.

```
{'doc_id':0, 'sents':[{'sent_id':0, 'entities':[{'text':'xxx', 'start':0, 'end':2, 'type':'xxx'}, ...]}, ...]}
...
```
